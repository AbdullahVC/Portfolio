  "About": {
    "p1": "I'm Abdullah. I was born in Germany and grew up in Turkey. For a period, I was interested in Islamic sciences; today my focus is on software.",
    "p2": "I am advancing in full-stack development and fully transitioning into the JavaScript ecosystem. I work with React, Next.js, TypeScript and Node.js. Clean code, sustainable structure and clear architecture are principles I carefully prioritize in every project.",
    "p3": "Software is not a profession for me; it is the way I turn what I imagine into reality. I write code to learn, create and leave a mark.",
    "p4": "Continuous improvement is not a goal for me, but a habit. One day I simplify API architecture, the next day I try a new UI framework. I am disciplined yet flexible, curious yet selective. I enjoy producing on my own as well as collaborating with a team that shares the same vision.",
    "p5": "My aim is not only to be a good developer, but to create lasting value that matters.",
